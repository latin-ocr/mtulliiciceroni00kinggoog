may be executed either as direct conversation, iu which none bnt the
speakers appear, and where, as in the soenes of n play, no infonnation is
ufforded, except from what the persons of the drama say to each other,
or as the recitsl of a conversation, where the author himself appears, and
efter a preliminary detail concerning the persons of the dialogus, end the
circumstances of time end place in which it was held, proceeds to give an
account of what passed in the discourse, at which he himself had been ἶ
present, or the import of which was communiceted to him, by some one
who had attended and borne his part in the conscience. It isthis letter ³
method, that has been followed in the dialogues de Oratore. l

Cicero mentions in his own person, that during the celebrationes certain κ
festivals et Rome, the orator Orassus retired to his villa at Tusculum,
whither he was accompanied by Antony, his most intimate friend in pri·
vate life, but most formidable rival in the Fomm3 and by his father-indaw,
Scoevola, who was the greatest jurisconsult of his age, and whose house
in the city was resorted to es an oracle, by men of the highest rank and
dignity. Crassus was also attended by cotta and Sulpicius, at that time
the two most promising oratoru of Rome; the former of whom afterwards
related to Cicero the conversation which passed among these distinguished
men, as they reclined on benches under a plane-tree, that grew on one of
the walks surrounding thevilla. It isnot improbable, that some such
conversation was actually held, end that Cicero, notwithstanding his age, 1
and the authority derived from his rhetorical reputation, chose to aveil
himself of this circumstance, in order to shelter his opinions under thom
of two ancient masters, who, previous to his own time, were regarded as
the chief organs of Roman eloquence.

During the meeting of these friends at Tusculum, Crassus is represent.
ed, in order to dissipate the gloom which had been occasioned by a serious
and even melancholy conversation on the situation of public affairs, to
have turned the discourse on oratory. The sentiments which he expresses
on this subject, are supposed to he those which Cicero himself entertained.
In order to excite the two young men, Cotta end Sulpicius, to prosecute
with ardor the career they hed so successfully commenced, he first en·
larges on the utility and excellence of oratory3 and then, procesdiug to
the object which he had principally in view, he contends that an almost
universal knowledge is essentially requisite to perfectiori in this noble nrt.

He afterwards enumeratos those brenches of knowledge which the orator
should acquire, und the purposes to which he should epply them: he in·
culcates the necessity of an acquaintance with the antiquities, manners,
and constitution of the republic, the constant exercise of written compost·
