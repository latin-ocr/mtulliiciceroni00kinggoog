For the better understanding of the dialoguas de Oratore, some account
of their design and general character may be advantageous to the student.
Cicero, in his youth, had published some undigested observations on the
subject of eloquendo, but considering these aa unworthy ol the character
which ho afterwards acquired, he undertook to write a trectise on the art,
more commensurate to his matured talenta. This work he composed in
tha form ot* dialogue, a species of composition, which, though much ern·
plcyed by the Greeks, had not bean attempted before at Rome. By adopt·
ing this mode ol writing, he avoided that dogmatioal air, which a treatise
from him on such a subject would necessarily have worn. Dialogue, like·
aiae, relieved monotony of style, hy affording opportunity of varying it
according to the characters of the different spanhem-it tcmpered tha
amterity of precept by the cheersnlness of conversation, and developed
each opinion with the vivacity and fnlness naturally employed in oral dis·
ousion. To this may be added, the facility which it presented of paying
an acceptable complinrent to the friends, who were introduced as interlo-
cutors, and its susceptibility cs agreeable description of the soenes, in which
the persons ol the dialogus were placed.
