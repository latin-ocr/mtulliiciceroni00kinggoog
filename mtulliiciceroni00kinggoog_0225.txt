The complaint is sometimes mode, that in reading the trestiss de Ore-
tore, especially lor tho first time, a difficulty is found in traeing the con·
nection of its several parts. For the purpose os rendering the transitione
from one speaker to another, and from one portion of tho discussion to en-
other, more obvious to the student, a particular analysis ol the contenta ol
the three books isdlstributsd through the notes. The parts of this analy-
sis are separated, so as to correspond to the most important divisions ol
the argument3 and the render, by keeping in view these brief abstracte,

, will be greatly assisted in discovering the general sim and scope of any

portion ol 'the dialogues. The notes aro chiefly selected from the prin·
cipal commentators on Cicero, with little variationes languege. Most of

them are untranslated; as, in the opinion ot the editor, both the auslysis ,

and the notes in their present state, if familiarity with the Latin is an ob·
ject, will be more usesul to the student, st the age when this work' is eom-
monly read, and under a competent instructor, than if they were written

v in English. Asew notiees only are given os the oratoru, poete, philoso-

phers and historiens, whose names so frequently occur iu the work. Mors
rull accounts ot* them the student can easily find in a elsssioel dictiousry.
