Antony, who was a mere practical pleader, considered philosophy ond the
civil law as useless to the orator, being foreign to the real business of life.
He concmves that eloquence might subsist without thern, and that with

regard to the other eccomplishmeuts enumerated by Crassus, they were
totally distinct from the proper office and duty of a public speaker. It is
accordingly agreed, that on the following day Antony should state his no.
tione of the nequirements appropriate to an emtor.

Preeious to the commenccrnent of thc second conversation, which is re·
ported in the second bools, the party is joined by Catulus and Julius Cressr,
(grand-uncle to the Dictator,) two of tho most eminent oratore of tho
time3 the former being distinguished for the elegeuce aud purity of bis
diction, and the latterfor his pleasantry. Having met Scaevols, oniris
way from Tusculum to the villa of Laelius, and having heard from him
of the mteresting conversation which had been deferred to the morrow,
they came over from a neighboring villa to partake of the entertninment.
In their proeence, and in that os Crassus, Antony maintains bis favorite
system, that eloquenceis aot an ert, because it depende not on knowledge
Imitation of good models, practice, and minute attention to each particu-
lar case, which should be scrupulonsly examined in all its bearings, are
laid down by him as the inundatione of forensic eloqueuce. The great
objects of au orator being, in the first ploce, to recommend himself to his
mene, and then to prepossess the audience end judgos in their favor,
Antony eularges on the practice of the bar, iu conciliatiug, infor-ming,
moring, and undeceiving those on whom the decision of causes depends3
all which is copiously illustrated by exemplos drawn from particular
questions, which hed occurred st Rome in cases of proof, of strict law,
or of equity. The chief weight ond importauce is attributed to moviug
tbe springs of the passione. Among the methods of conciliation and pre·
possession, humor and drollery ere particularly mentioued Cesar being
the oratorical witot the company, is requested to giro some exemplos of
forensic jests. The length of his dhoourse on this topic, shows the im·

the orator.
